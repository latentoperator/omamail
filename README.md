# Omamail

Omamail is a native email and calendar app with multiple accounts and keyboard navigation. It runs either as an Omarchy shell plugin or as a standalone Qt desktop application.

## Install

### Omarchy plugin

The plugin requires **Omarchy 4** and follows the active Omarchy theme. It includes the bar widget, `mailto:` integration, and AI assistance through the configured Omarchy agent.

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/huacnlee/omamail.git --enable
```

Update it with:

```bash
omarchy plugin update omamail
```

Click the envelope in the bar, install the pinned backend when prompted, and add your mailbox. Prebuilt plugin backends are available for Linux x86_64 and aarch64.

### Standalone desktop app

The standalone app includes mail, calendar, and native desktop notifications. It has no system tray, AI assistance, or operating-system `mailto:` registration in this release.

macOS & Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://huacnlee.github.io/omamail/install.sh | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://huacnlee.github.io/omamail/install.ps1 | iex
```

Each installer verifies the release package before replacing an existing version. The macOS app and Windows executable are unsigned. The macOS installer removes quarantine only after verifying the downloaded archive. See [standalone runtime and release details](docs/BACKEND-RUNTIME.md#standalone-bundled-backend) for package layout, platform integration, installer behavior, and security checks.

## Run from source

Install Rust, CMake 3.21 or newer, and Qt 6.5 or newer, then use the repository Make targets:

```bash
make app-run
```

`make app-run` builds the standalone backend without the AI feature, builds the Qt host, and launches it from the source resources. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for validation commands.

## Features

- **Multiple mailboxes:** Gmail, Outlook, HEY, JMAP and IMAP/SMTP, including Fastmail, iCloud and self-hosted servers.
- **Mail and calendar:** read, search, compose, manage attachments and respond to meeting invitations. Available actions depend on your provider.
- **Keyboard navigation:** `j`/`k` to move, `r` to reply, `c` to compose, `/` to search and `?` for all shortcuts.
- **AI assistance in Omarchy:** ask about selected messages and review suggested drafts using your Omarchy AI setup. See [AI assistance](docs/AGENT.md).
- **Desktop integration:** native notifications and a compact layout for smaller windows; the Omarchy plugin also provides the bar widget and `mailto:` integration.
- **Privacy controls:** credentials stored in the system keyring and remote images blocked until you choose to load them.

## Add your mailbox

Choose a provider in Settings. Gmail needs a Google OAuth client; Outlook needs a Microsoft app registration. HEY uses the official [HEY CLI](https://github.com/basecamp/hey-cli). JMAP and IMAP usually use an app password or API token.

See [mailbox setup](docs/MAILBOXES.md) for provider instructions and limitations, including Microsoft 365 and Proton Mail Bridge.

## Open the Omarchy plugin from the keyboard

Add this to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + G", "Omamail", "omarchy shell shell toggle omamail '{}'")
```

Press `?` in Omamail for the shortcut sheet, or see the [keyboard guide](docs/KEYS.md).
